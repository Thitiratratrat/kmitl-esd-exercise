# KMITL ESD EXERCISE 3 by Thitirat
This exercise is done for the course enterprise software development. The
 exercise aims to demonstrate software layers and its
  dependencies. The exercise demonstrates these software concepts by creating
   a basic CRUD application that provides REST services for managing
    customers and their quotations.
    
  The exercise has 2 modules: client and customer service. The client and
   customer service follows the client server architecture. The client module
    contains code that calls the customer service. The customer service
     module provides REST services for the customers to use.
     
Further descriptions of each module can be found in each module's README file.
